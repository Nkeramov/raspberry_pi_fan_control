# Raspberry Pi fan control

This project provides examples of fan control based on the current CPU temperature.

It includes implementations of a relay controller and a proportional controller. 

The fan is connected via a transistor switch to the 4th pin of the I/O ports. The fan connection pin can be changed in scripts. The remaining parameters can be set at startup.

Use run.sh to run project.
